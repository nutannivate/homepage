Webdesign
=========

This is the repo where I store everything I create during the web 
design course at school. 

The site stored here is the main project and also the testing space
for the subprojects

## Warning
I have a tendency to write ugly and undocumented code!

## Subprojects
The subprojects (javascript libraries) developed while creating this
site

### ShareThis
ShareThis is a javascript library which simplifies the insertion of 
social media sharing links/icons in an elegant matter. It features
an easy-to-use API which allows almost any layout to be "crafted"
easily using just a few lines of javascript code. 

The development of ShareThis is an a very early stage, so be prepared
to experience a LOT of bugs in this library.

### NiceAlert
NiceAlert is an elegant replacement for the javascript alert function.

### SCPlayer
SCPlayer is an SWFObject wrapper around the SoundCloud flash player.
It simplifies the deployment of SoundCloud flash players by utilizing
SWFObject.

##Requirements
To view this site properly, a javascript and CSS 3 compatible browser
is required. I recommend Chromium but recent versions of other browsers
should work as well.

### Technical requirements
 * jQuery - I use jQuery as my library of choice and therefore almost 
   all of my own libraries depend on it.
 * SWFObject - SWFObject is used in the SCPlayer subproject
